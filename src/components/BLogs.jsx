              A controlled component is a component that receives its state and
              any necessary callbacks as props from its parent component. This
              means that the parent component has complete control over the
              state and behavior of the controlled component. Examples of
              controlled components in React include input elements that use the
              "value" attribute and onChange callback, and form elements that
              use the "checked" attribute and onChange callback.

              On the other hand, An uncontrolled component is a component that
              manages its own state internally, without any input or control
              from its parent component. This means that the parent component
              has no way of knowing or modifying the state of the uncontrolled
              component. Examples of uncontrolled components in React include
              input elements that use the "defaultValue" attribute instead of
              the "value" attribute, and form elements that use the
              "defaultChecked" attribute instead of the "checked" attribute.

              <li>
                When the component is used, pass the props as an object to the

                the propTypes definition.

                Difference between node Js and React Js:
              </strong>{" "}
              <br />
              Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code
              outside of a web browser. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine from
              Google Chrome and allows developers to run JavaScript code on the
              server-side. Express.js, on the other hand, is a web application
              framework built on top of Node.js. Here are some differences
              between Node.js and Express.js: <br /> <br />
            </p>
            <div className="mt-3 px-12 space-y-4 ">
              <li>
                Node.js provides a runtime environment for JavaScript, while
                Express.js is a web application framework that uses Node.js as
                its runtime environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Node.js allows developers to write server-side JavaScript code
                that can interact with the file system, network, and other
                system resources. Express.js provides a set of tools and APIs
                for building web applications on top of Node.js, such as
                routing, middleware, and HTTP request handling.
              </li>
              <li>
                Node.js provides low-level APIs for working with HTTP requests
                and responses, but it does not provide a high-level abstraction
                for building web applications. Express.js provides a
                higher-level abstraction for building web applications, making
                it easier and faster to build complex web applications.
              </li>
              <li>
                Express.js is built on top of Node.js and provides a lot of the
                same features, but it is more opinionated and provides more
                structure and organization to web application development.
              </li>
              <li>
                Node.js can be used to build a wide range of applications, not
                just web applications. Express.js is specifically designed for
                building web applications and provides a lot of functionality
                that is not necessary for other types of applications.
              </li>
              <p className=" text-lg py-3">
                Overall, Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript code,
                while Express.js is a web application framework that uses
                Node.js as its runtime environment and provides a set of tools
                and APIs for building web applications. While they are related,
                they serve different purposes and are used for different types
                of projects.

              <br />A custom hook in React is a function that allows you to
              encapsulate reusable logic and stateful behavior that can be
              shared across multiple components. Custom hooks are used to
              simplify and reduce the amount of code needed to manage complex
              logic that is used in multiple places within a React application.{" "}

              <li>
                <strong> Identify the shared logic:</strong> Look for any common
                patterns or behaviors that are used across multiple components
                in your application. For example, you might have several
                components that need to fetch data from an API and display it on
                the page.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Create a function:</strong> Write a JavaScript function
                that contains the shared logic and returns the necessary values.
                This function can be reused in multiple components.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Add a hook prefix:</strong> Add the word "use" to the
                beginning of the function name. This naming convention is used
                in React to indicate that the function is a custom hook.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Use React hooks:</strong> Use any of the built-in React
                hooks that your custom hook may need, such as useState or
                useEffect.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Export the custom hook:</strong> Export the custom hook
                function from your module so that other components can use it.
              </li>
              <p className=" text-lg py-3">
                Creating custom hooks can help you encapsulate complex logic or
                functionality in a reusable package, making it easier to write
                and maintain code in your application.
